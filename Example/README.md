# AdvancedList-SwiftUI

This repository contains a usage example of my Swift package for an advanced **SwiftUI** `List view` which adds **pagination** and an **empty, error and loading state** on top of the existing `List view`. You can find the Swift package [here](https://github.com/crelies/AdvancedList).

## Motivation

I often deal with lists which can have different view states (empty, error, items or loading). Currently I use an extended version of **IGListKit** to create these advanced lists in my UIKit applications.
